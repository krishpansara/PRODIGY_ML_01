# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview

This notebook is part of **Task 01** of my **Prodigy InfoTech Machine Learning Internship**.  
The goal of this task is to build a **regression-based machine learning model** to predict house prices using historical housing data.

House price prediction is a classic supervised learning problem that demonstrates how machine learning can model relationships between multiple features and a continuous target variable.

## Problem Statement

The dataset contains information about residential properties, including features related to size, structure, and amenities.  
The objective is to **predict the sale price of a house** based on these input features.

This task focuses on understanding how linear regression captures relationships between variables and how model performance is evaluated in real-world scenarios.

## What This Project Covers

This notebook implements an end-to-end regression workflow, including:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Understanding feature distributions, correlations, and trends affecting house prices.

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  Handling missing values, feature selection, and preparing data for modeling.

- **Supervised Learning Approach**  
  Building a **Linear Regression** model to predict house prices.

- **Model Training & Prediction**  
  Training the model on historical data and generating predictions.

- **Model Evaluation**  
  Evaluating performance using regression metrics to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
